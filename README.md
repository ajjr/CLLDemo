# A Simple Lemmatizer for Classical Languages
This app creates a lemmatized table of words in a Greek or Latin text. It's purpose is to demonstrate the ability to analyze classical languages and serve as a platform for further development if needed. Right now it uses CLTK's BackoffLemmatizer classes. In react-gui there is a small React app to test the headless api. It serves as an alternative user interface to the default static html pages.
